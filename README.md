# Advanced Algorithms in Python

**Technologies:** Python, Jupyter Notebook  

A collection of algorithm implementations from the **Advanced Algorithm** course, covering topics such as **Dynamic Programming (DP), Greedy Algorithms, and Randomized Algorithms**.  

This repository was built as part of class assignments and peer code reviews, and also serves as a **portfolio to showcase algorithmic problem-solving skills** for academic and professional purposes.
